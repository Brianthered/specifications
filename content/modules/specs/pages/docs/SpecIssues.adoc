## Open Topics

There are a number of open topics that have not yet been addressed in this public review draft specification. They are briefly described below, organized by the relevant section of the specification. 

### xref:_assertions[Assertions]

* Support for marking a previous claim or assertion as "retracted", a feature commonly used in the news publication industry. 

### xref:_binding_to_content[Binding to Content]

* Add support for the binding of live video streams, 3D formats and audio formats.

* Addressing the case where servers make real-time modifications to content streamed to a client, potentially altering the cryptographic hash used to bind ISO BMFF content to a manifest. 

* Determining whether the box exclusion list used for hashing a BMFF-formatted asset in the fragmented MP4 case needs to support having each fragment have its own exclusion list (e.g. if the subset to hash must be fragment-specific).

### xref:_trust_model[Trust Model]

* Supporting additional credential types for use in signing manifests.

### xref:_validation[Validation]

* Design for how a video player can communicate with the media validator to indicate that a discontinuity in video playback is expected, perhaps due to seek, fast forward, or other types of "trick play".

### xref:_user_experience[User Experience]

* Working with the W3C and browser vendors to define a standardized model for exposing the provenance data to user agents.
