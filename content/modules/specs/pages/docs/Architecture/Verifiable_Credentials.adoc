## W3C Verifiable Credentials

### General

In some use cases, the actors in the system may wish to provide their own https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/[W3C Verifiable Credential], as they exist at that moment in time, to the claim generator to have them associated with one or more assertions. These actors may be individuals, groups or organizations. 

W3C Verifiable Credentials are used in this specification to _decorate_ the actors identified in assertions with more information, potentially providing additional trust signals. Although these W3C Verifiable Credentials can include proofs of their own authenticity, they are *not* a mechanism for verifying that a particular actor authorised a claim, assertion or piece of metadata. Any validation or usage of the W3C Verifiable Credential is out of scope of this specification and has no bearing on the xref:_trust_model[C2PA Trust Model].

For example, conveying a W3C Verifiable Credential for the actor identified as the `author` in an assertion might link that author's ID with an email address, social media ID, or real name, or it might identify that actor as a member of a particular professional body, or provide other qualifications relevant to the actor's involvement in the asset.

Such credentials shall be compliant with the https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/[W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model] using the https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-ld[JSON-LD serialisation] described there.

[NOTE]
====
JSON-LD serialization is mandated as it is the most commonly used of the three syntaxes presented in section 6 of the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification. It is also the one that aligns best with its extensibility model, which could be useful to some implementors.
====

An example of a compliant credential for an individual might be one issued by the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA), which links an identifier for a person to their name ("John Doe") and a statement about their membership of the NPPA. It might look like:

A W3C Verifiable Credential used with C2PA shall contain only a single `credentialSubject` and that `credentialSubject` shall have an `id` value.

[NOTE]
====
Although the example above and many examples in the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model specification use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as the value of the `id` field, DIDs are not necessary for W3C Verifiable Credentials to be useful. Specifically, W3C Verifiable Credentials do not depend on DIDs and DIDs do not depend on W3C Verifiable Credentials. DID-based URLs are just one way to express identifiers associated with subjects, issuers, holders, credential status lists, cryptographic keys, and other machine-readable information associated with a W3C Verifiable Credential.

### VCStore

The set of credentials in a manifest are collected together into a logical construct that is referred to as the *credential store* or *VCStore* (for short) and it shall be stored as described in <<_use_of_jumbf>>.  Unlike the assertion store, the VCStore shall always be included in the JUMBF - it shall not be stored separately.

For each manifest, there is a VCStore associated with it. However, as an asset may have multiple manifests associated with it, there may be multiple VCStores associated with an asset.

### Using Credentials

Some assertions, such as xref:_creative_work[Creative Work] and xref:_actions[Actions], may contain references to Persons or Organisations which are responsible for various roles and responsibilities. These references to Actors are defined in <<_common_data_model_actor>>.

### Credential Security Considerations

In most W3C Verifiable Credential workflows, the information about the subject (e.g., the cryptographic keys) is fetched on demand at the time of validation. While that is an acceptable model, it does open up a possible attack vector by providing an attacker with an externally-visible signal about what the validator is validating. Therefore, C2PA also supports having the information captured and embedded at the time of signature. This not only prevents leakage, but also makes it very clear what data the signer is asserting about the credential's subject.
