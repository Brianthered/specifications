### Introductory terms

#### Actor
A human or non-human (hardware or software) that is participating in the C2PA ecosystem. For example: a camera (capture device), image editing software, cloud service or the person using such tools.

NOTE: An organization or group of _actors_ may also be considered an _actor_ in the C2PA ecosystem.

#### Signer
An actor (human or non-human) whose credential's private key is used to sign the claim.  The signer is identified by the subject of the credential.

#### Claim generator
The non-human (hardware or software) _actor_ that generates the _claim_ about an _asset_ as well as the _claim signature_, thus leading to the _asset_'s associated _manifest_. 

#### Manifest consumer
An _actor_ who consumes an _asset_ with an associated _manifest_ for the purpose of obtaining the _provenance data_ from the _manifest_.

#### Validator
A _manifest consumer_ whose role is to perform the actions described in <<_validation>>.

#### Action
An operation performed by an _actor_ on an _asset._ For example, "create", "embed", or "apply filter".

### Assets and Content
#### Digital content
The portion of an _asset_ that represents the actual content, such as the pixels of an image, along with any additional technical metadata required to understand the content (e.g., a colour profile or encoding parameters).

#### Asset metadata
The portion of an _asset_ that represents non-technical information about the _asset_ and its _digital content_, as may be stored via standards such as EXIF or XMP.

#### Asset
A file or stream of data containing _digital content_, _asset metadata_ and optionally, a C2PA _manifest_. 

NOTE: For the purposes of this definition, we will extend the typical definition of "file" to include cloud-native and dynamically generated data.

#### Derived asset
A derived asset is an _asset_ that is created by starting from an existing _asset_ and performing _actions_ to it that modify its _digital content_ and _asset metadata_. 

**EXAMPLE:** An audio stream that has been shortened or a document where pages have been added.

#### Asset rendition
A representation of an _asset_ (either as a part of an _asset_ or a completely new _asset_) where the _digital content_ has had a 'non-editorial transformation' _action_ (e.g., re-encoding or scaling) applied but where the _asset metadata_ has not been modified.

NOTE: This is also referred to as a _Facsimile Asset_

**EXAMPLE:** A video file that is re-encoded for reduced screen resolution or network bandwidth.

#### Composed asset
A composed asset is an _asset_ that is created by building up a collection of multiple parts or fragments of _digital content_ (referred to as ingredients) from one or more other _assets_. When starting from an existing _asset_, it is a special case of a _derived asset_ - however a _composed asset_ can also be one that starts from a "blank slate".

**EXAMPLE:** A video created by importing existing video clips and audio segments into a "blank slate". An image where another image is imported and super-imposed on top of the starting image. 

### Core Aspects of C2PA

#### Assertion
A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an _actor_ concerning the _asset_. This data is a part of the _manifest_.

#### Claim
A digitally signed and tamper-evident data structure that references a set of _assertions_ by one or more _actors_, concerning an _asset_, and the information necessary to represent the _content binding_. If any _assertions_ were redacted, then a declaration to that effect is included. This data is a part of the _manifest_.

#### Claim signature
The digital signature on the _claim_ using the private key of an _actor_. The claim signature is a part of the _manifest_.

#### Manifest
The set of information about the _provenance_ of an _asset_ based on the combination of one or more _assertions_ (including _content bindings_), a single _claim_, and a _claim signature_. A manifest can either be embedded into an _asset_ or be external to its _asset_.

NOTE: A manifest can reference other manifests.

#### Origin
The _manifest_ in the _provenance data_ which represents the method or device that initially created the _asset_.

NOTE: Details on how one determines which _manifest_ is the _origin_ are left for specification.

#### Active Manifest
The last manifest in the list of manifests which is the one with the set of _content bindings_ that are able to be validated.

#### Provenance
The logical concept of understanding the history of an _asset_ and its interaction with _actors_ and other _assets_, as represented by the _provenance data_.

#### Provenance data
The set of _manifests_ for an _asset_ and, in the case of a _composed asset_, its ingredients.

#### Authenticity
A property of _digital content_ comprising a set of facts (_provenance data_ and _hard bindings_) that can be cryptographically verified as not having been tampered with.

#### Content binding
Information that associates _digital content_ to a specific _manifest_ associated with a specific _asset_, either as a _hard binding_ or a _soft binding_.

#### Hard binding
One or more cryptographic hashes that uniquely identifies either the entire _asset_ or a portion thereof.

#### Soft binding
A content identifier that is either (a) not statistically unique, such as a _fingerprint_, or (b) embedded as a _watermark_ in the identified content.

#### Trust signals
The collection of information that can inform an _actor's_ judgment of the trustworthiness of an _asset_. These are in addition to the _signer_ of a _claim_, upon which the fundamental trust model relies.

### Additional Terms

#### Fingerprint
A set of inherent properties computable from _digital content_ that identifies the content or near duplicates of it. 

**EXAMPLE:** An _asset_ can become separated from its _manifest_ due to removal or corruption of _asset_ metadata. A _fingerprint_ of the _digital content_ of the _asset_ could be used to search a database to recover the _asset_ with an intact _manifest_.

#### Watermark
Information incorporated into the _digital content_ (perceptibly or imperceptibly) of an _asset_ which can be used, for example, to uniquely identify the _asset_ or to store a reference to a _manifest_.

#### Provenance datastore
A repository into which C2PA _manifests_ can be placed, and which can be searched using a _content binding_.
